                    Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton,
                    and Helena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays
                    the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a "fight club" with a
                    soap salesman, Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman,
                    Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).
